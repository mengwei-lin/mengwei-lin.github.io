## Welcome!
I am a Managing Economist at [Berkeley Research Group](https://www.thinkbrg.com/){:target="_blank"}. I received a Ph.D. in Applied Economics and Management from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"} in 2024. In 2022-2023, I visited the Department of Economics at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests are **Public Economics**, **Political Economy**, and **Firm Behavior**. I conduct research to understand the relationship between government and business, with a focus on China, Africa, and the US.

You can reach me at ml2622(at)cornell.edu. Here is my [CV](lin_cv.pdf).
