## Welcome!
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Economics and Management at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I am on the job market in the 2023-2024 academic year. Here is my [CV](lin_cv.pdf). You can reach me at ml2622(at)cornell.edu.

My research interests are **Public Economics**, **Political Economy**, and **Firm Behavior**. I conduct research to understand the relationship between government and business, with a focus on China, Africa, and the US.

I visited the Department of Economics at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"} for the academic year 2022-2023.
