## About me
  
- I leverage and develop quantitative methods from Spatial Economics and Industrial Organization literature to understand the bureaucracy and administrative processes in public organizations. <br>
- My Ph.D. dissertation explores China’s land market mechanisms, which contains millions of transactions over ten years. In my job market paper, I investigate the impacts of local government competition on firms’ location decisions.
