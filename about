- I am Mengwei Lin, a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University. My research interests are Public Economics, Urban Economics, and Industrial Organization. I leverage and develop quantitative methods from Spatial Economics and Industrial Organization literature to understand the bureaucracy and administrative processes in public organizations.   
- My Ph.D. dissertation explores China’s land market mechanisms, which contains millions of transactions over ten years. In my job market paper, I investigate the impacts of local government competition on firms’ location decisions.
